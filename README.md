# A Prelim Case Study for Software Engineering 1
The manager of a Tool and Die Shop needs help with job processing and control. Jobs are currently
processed by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates the time and
materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is scheduled
for a specific day and estimated time.
On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are
not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also
used to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are processed by hand, and the final calculations are
entered into the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting
records will be updated and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order,
but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The
management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or
machine, or by any worker.

REQUIREMENTS:
Based on the given scenario, create a system that will help the manager in solving the problem
encountered by the Tool and Die Shop

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
